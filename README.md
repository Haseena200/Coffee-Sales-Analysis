# Coffee-Sales-Analysis
This MySQL project analyzes coffee sales data to understand product performance, sales by state, and profit vs target profit. It uses SQL queries to extract insights and support business decisions.

# Coffee-Sales-Analysis
##  Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from a coffee business to extract insights about performance across different products, states, and time periods. The analysis helps identify top-performing products, evaluate marketing effectiveness, and measure actual performance against targets.

Project Aim:
To perform descriptive analysis on a coffee sales dataset using SQL and derive actionable business insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Questions 
- What is the total revenue and total profit of the coffee business?
- Which products are generating the most sales?
- Which states contribute the most to total sales?
- How does the actual profit compare with the target profit for each product?
- Which markets and market sizes are most profitable?
- What is the performance trend by product type (e.g., Decaf vs Regular)?
- How effective are different marketing strategies?

  ## Project Insights
- States like Colorado and markets such as "Central Asia" have high sales figures.
- In several cases, actual profits fall short of targets, highlighting underperformance.
- Marketing strategies and product types impact performance.

  ## Process Overview
- Database Creation: Created a new database Coffee_Sales.
- Table Creation: Designed the coffee_sales table with relevant business fields.
- Data Insertion: Populated the table with sample sales data.
- Exploratory Queries:
- Aggregated sales, profit, and revenue by product and region.
- Compared actual vs. target values.
- Identified best-performing strategies and market segments.
- Reporting: Results were structured to support visualization and dashboarding.

## Conclusion
- This SQL project demonstrates the value of structured query analysis in identifying high-value products, underperforming regions, and gaps between actual and targeted performance. These insights can inform better strategic decisions in sales and marketing.
